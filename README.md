### 🏗️ Tasks
- Create an application in which:
  - A list of Pokemons is displayed with paginated results (each item should contain: name, height, weight and image)
  - The user should be able to click on one Pokemon and be redirected to another page where all information about that Pokemon is displayed with a link to go back to the previous page
  - The user should be able to see the current page, the total number of pages and to go to next/previous page
  - The user should be able to select how many items to be displayed per page (10, 20, 50)
  - The user should be able to sort the results by name, height and weight
  - The user should be able to filter the current page by Pokemon’s name
  - The filter and sort should persist on a page refresh 
- Bonus points: 
  - Cache the data received from the api
  - Deploy the solution
